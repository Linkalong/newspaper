The coalition said details about the incident are being withheld pending further investigation. Dunbar was assigned to the headquarters of US Army Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the Pentagon said. Trump says US will withdraw from Syria 'very soon' Tonroe was "deployed numerous times on operations to Afghanistan and the Middle East," the UK ministry said. "His distinguished service reflected a man that was happiest when professionally tested on operations," a ministry statement said. "He relished responsibility, the opportunity to contribute and when the time came, to lead. He was a natural in this role." The United States maintains about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mostly work with local allies fighting ISIS. President Donald Trump said Thursday that the United States would "be coming out of Syria like very soon," just hours after the Pentagon highlighted the need for US troops to remain in the country for the immediate future.
