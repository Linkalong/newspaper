By now the Serial theme song has been chopped a screwed a million different ways by a million different people, including us for our Serial Serial podcast. But that little kid that says “mail kimp?” That’s a different story. Soundcloud user kpffkl has created the “Mail Kimp Remix” to give that little kid some glory, and it’s both annoying and mesmerizing, as most remixes of a single sound are, but it’s still new and potentially interesting Serial-related content, something the Internet is certainly hungry for this holiday season.
